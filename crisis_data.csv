Cyprus,DECEMBER 2024,"Turkish Cypriot leadership criticised UN Security Council and EU, while Türkiye warned Republic of Cyprus that its military build-up could trigger arms race.","Turkish Cypriot leadership criticised UN Security Council and EU, while Türkiye warned Republic of Cyprus that its military build-up could trigger arms race. Republic of Cyprus continued military build-up. Amid growing military cooperation with Western countries, Republic of Cyprus 5 Dec received first batch of Iron Dome missile defence system from Israel, replacing older Russian-made air defences, prompting consternation in “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” (“TRNC”); Republic of Cyprus is also set to acquire combat helicopters from France and new tanks to replace older Russian-made models. In response, Turkish FM Hakan Fidan 11 Dec expressed concern about Greek Cypriot armament efforts, warning that it could trigger arms race on island. Republic of Cyprus President Christodoulides 30 Dec stated that Mari and Andreas Papandreou military bases on island could be allocated to U.S. or any other country requesting to use them for humanitarian purposes. Turkish Cypriot authorities accused UN and EU of bias. “TRNC” FM Tahsin Ertuğruloğlu 15 Dec criticised UN Security Council and EU, asserting “the real parties that deserve criticism and condemnation are the UN Security Council and the international community led by the EU, who have allowed the crimes committed by Greek Cypriots to go unpunished”, adding that these actors “have given the Greek Cypriots the opportunity to impose embargoes against us”."
Georgia,DECEMBER 2024,Countrywide protests and accompanying crackdown continued amid ongoing political crisis; de facto lawmaker shot dead fellow MP in breakaway Abkhazia region.,"Countrywide protests and accompanying crackdown continued amid ongoing political crisis; de facto lawmaker shot dead fellow MP in breakaway Abkhazia region. Govt clampdown on protests continued. Anti-govt protests, which began at small-scale after disputed parliamentary elections in Oct but which expanded across country late Nov after govt suspended EU accession talks, took place almost daily (though intensity gradually diminished). Among protesters’ demands were calls for new election and return to EU accession process. Govt crackdown continued, prompting concern among human rights groups. Notably, Amnesty International 13 Dec warned that protesters faced “brutal dispersal tactics, arbitrary detention and torture” while Human Rights Watch 23 Dec accused security forces of “widespread and apparently punitive acts”. Adding to instability, electoral college 14 Dec selected ex-footballer and far-right politician Mikheil Kavelashvili as Georgia’s new president, who was sworn in 29 Dec. Outgoing president Salome Zourabichvili left presidential palace but continued to dismiss her successor as illegitimate. Foreign actors imposed more punitive measures against ruling party figures. Notably, Estonia’s FM 1 Dec said all three Baltic States had agreed to impose “national sanctions against those who suppressed legitimate protests”; EU 20 Dec announced proposal to suspend visa-free travel for Georgian diplomats; and U.S. 27 Dec sanctioned Georgian Dream’s billionaire founder, Bidzina Ivanishvili. De facto MP killed fellow lawmaker in breakaway Abkhazia. Dispute 19 Dec erupted in de facto parliamentary committee meeting between two de facto lawmakers, Adgur Kharazia and Kan Kvarchia, over proposed crackdown on illegal cryptocurrency mining, which has aggravated energy crisis by putting additional strain on electricity network. Kharazia pulled out firearm, killing de facto MP Vakhtang Golandziya by accident and wounding Kvarchia. Incident added to simmering tensions in breakaway, which will hold snap presidential election on 15 Feb. Meanwhile, Russia 23 Dec began delivering electricity into Abkhazia to help alleviate energy crisis, later making clear that, in return, it expected de facto lawmakers to pass controversial legislation enabling Russian property purchases in breakaway."
Türkiye,DECEMBER 2024,Ankara welcomed fall of Assad regime in Syria as Türkiye-backed forces pressed against Kurdish-led forces in Syria’s north east; military continued targeting Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in northern Iraq.,"Ankara welcomed fall of Assad regime in Syria as Türkiye-backed forces pressed against Kurdish-led forces in Syria’s north east; military continued targeting Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in northern Iraq. Fall of Assad regime in Syria marked turning point for Ankara. Following dramatic collapse of House of Assad in Syria on 8 Dec (see Syria and Conflict in Focus), Ankara found its strategic position much improved: fall of Assad marked blow to Türkiye’s regional competitors Russia and Iran, reduced threat of refugee flows and boosted prospect of returning millions of Syrian refugees in Türkiye, and provided Ankara with potential to wield greater influence given its relations with Hei’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and armed groups that participated in offensive to topple Assad. Meanwhile, Ankara-backed local forces in Syria expelled U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces – led by PKK-affiliated People’s Protection Units (YPG) – from areas in north, raising prospect of further clashes (though U.S. brokerage halted advances as of 31 Dec). FM Hakan Fidan 13 Dec warned “YPG either dissolves itself or will be dissolved”. Military continued operations against PKK. In northern Iraq, military 1 Dec announced it “neutralised” nine militants, 13 Dec two militants, 20 Dec 11 militants and 28 Dec two militants. Meanwhile, at home, govt continued crackdown against pro-Kurdish political party (DEM) and its municipalities even as discussions around new political process to end 40-year conflict with PKK advanced; govt 31 Dec allowed delegation from DEM party to visit imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan. Authorities conducted operations against Islamic State (ISIS) countrywide. Security forces during Dec detained some 680 alleged ISIS members. Notably, Ministry of Interior 31 Dec announced authorities had detained 536 suspects across 57 provinces in operations 19-31 Dec. Ankara continued engagement with Greece.

In address to parliament, FM Hakan Fidan 11 Dec reaffirmed govt’s commitment to “positive agenda” with Greece; Greece and Republic of Cyprus are concerned about prospect of Türkiye and new Syrian govt striking maritime delimitation deal."
Cyprus,NOVEMBER 2024,Republic of Cyprus and Turkish presidents informally met at European summit amid UN efforts to explore diplomatic path forward.,"Republic of Cyprus and Turkish presidents informally met at European summit amid UN efforts to explore diplomatic path forward. Republic of Cyprus President Christodoulides and Turkish President Erdoğan 7 Nov met informally on sidelines of European Political Community summit in Hungarian capital Budapest; “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” (“TRNC”) “FM” Tahsin Ertuğruloğlu next day stated meeting was not “official” as Türkiye does not recognise Republic of Cyprus, adding “such encounters are overemphasised in the media and are not of significant importance”. At high-level meeting in Greece’s capital Athens, Turkish FM Hakan Fidan 8 Nov reiterated that federal solution to Cyprus was not viable, stressing need for new approach, while his Greek counterpart Giorgos Gerapetritis reaffirmed Greece’s commitment to bi-zonal, bi-communal federation outlined in UN Security Council resolutions.

Georgia,NOVEMBER 2024,"Police violently cracked down on countrywide demonstrations, triggered by govt decision to suspend its EU membership bid until 2028; leader of breakaway Abkhazia region resigned amid mass protests.","Police violently cracked down on countrywide demonstrations, triggered by govt decision to suspend its EU membership bid until 2028; leader of breakaway Abkhazia region resigned amid mass protests. Mass protests against govt suspension of EU accession bid were met with force. PM Kobakhidze 28 Nov announced govt would suspend EU membership bid until at least 2028, reversing promise made during campaign for Oct parliamentary polls to pursue EU integration. Declaration triggered large-scale protests in capital Tbilisi and Batumi city, which quickly spread to other urban centres across Georgia. Police responded violently, using tear gas, water cannons and truncheons against protesters while reportedly beating some individuals, including journalists. Number of Georgian officials late Nov resigned, citing govt’s announcement, while U.S. and several European countries denounced repression, with Washington 30 Nov announcing suspension of U.S.-Georgia Strategic Partnership. Crisis risks undermining already contested legitimacy of new govt, elected in Oct poll that opposition alleges was rigged. Breakaway Abkhazia’s de facto leader resigned amid protests. Large-scale opposition protests 15 Nov erupted in Sukhumi, de facto capital of breakaway Abkhazia region, amid tensions over draft legislation granting preferential treatment for Russian real estate developers, which locals feared could price them out of property market. Demonstrators clashed with security forces before storming regional govt complex to demand resignation of de facto President Bzhania. After four-day standoff, de facto govt and opposition reached agreement for Bzhania 19 Nov to step down in exchange for dispersal of protesters, paving way for snap election; agreement, however, did not address fate of bill."
Türkiye,NOVEMBER 2024,"Military continued pressure on Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in Iraq and Syria, while govt closely watched rebel offensive in northern Syria and pursued engagement with Baghdad and Greece.","Military continued pressure on Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in Iraq and Syria, while govt closely watched rebel offensive in northern Syria and pursued engagement with Baghdad and Greece. Govt continued operations against PKK, while mulling new political process. Military continued strikes on PKK in Iraq and Syria after deadly PKK attack in Ankara in Oct that killed five and injured 22. Notably, military 22 Nov announced it neutralised nine PKK members in northern Iraq and northern Syria, including senior member. Meanwhile, speculation continued around details of possible new process between govt and PKK after President Erdoğan and his nationalist ally Devlet Bahçeli in Oct signalled willingness. Govt pressure on pro-Kurdish DEM party continued; notably, Ministry of Interior during Nov appointed trustees to five municipalities to replace elected DEM officials. Authorities continued crackdown on Islamic State (ISIS). Authorities during Nov detained some 77 individuals with suspected links to ISIS. Notably, police 6 Nov arrested three individuals for providing financial support to group in multi-province operation. Ankara monitored rebel advance in Syria’s north west. As rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied Turkish-backed factions 27 Nov launched major offensive against govt forces in Syria’s north west, FM Hakan Fidan 30 Nov remarked “Türkiye is not involved in the clashes” and “We will not engage in any action that might trigger a new wave of migration”; govt and Russia prepared counteroffensive and intensified airstrikes/shelling, which risks displacing hundreds of thousands of Syrians toward Turkish border (see Syria). Govt engaged Iraq and held high-level meeting in Greece. In second visit to Türkiye since 2022, Iraqi PM Mohammed Sudani 1 Nov met Erdoğan in Ankara, where pair reportedly discussed bilateral cooperation initiatives, including Development Road project.

Georgia,OCTOBER 2024,Ruling party claimed victory in parliamentary poll dismissed as fraudulent by opposition; chorus of Western voices called for investigations into reports of election violations.,"Ruling party claimed victory in parliamentary poll dismissed as fraudulent by opposition; chorus of Western voices called for investigations into reports of election violations. Ruling party claimed victory in election disputed by opposition. Following weeks of intense campaigning in highly polarised environment, voters 26 Oct cast ballots in parliamentary elections, viewed by many as pivotal moment determining whether Georgia will integrate into West. Central Election Commission 27 Oct announced ruling Georgian Dream party had won with over 54% of vote, securing large number of votes in rural areas while opposition won big in major cities. An overall unfair playing field and reports of voter intimidation, as well as violence and ballot stuffing at polling stations, led to mixed assessment from joint monitoring mission led by Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Opposition parties rejected results as “fraudulent” and said they would boycott national assembly while President Zourabichvili, leading proponent of EU integration who has amplified calls to reject outcome, 27 Oct claimed result was thanks to “Russian special operation”. State prosecutors 30 Oct summoned Zourabichvili to present evidence of electoral fraud. Opposition’s refusal to recognise results could set stage for potential political crisis. Meanwhile, thousands of Georgians 28 Oct flooded streets of capital Tbilisi in protest. Western representatives called for investigations into irregularities during vote. EU High Representative Josep Borrell 29 Oct called for “transparent inquiry” into reports of “irregularities, pressure and intimidation on voters”; U.S. President Biden same day echoed call and voiced concern about democratic “backsliding” in Georgia amid deteriorating relations with West. Russia 28 Oct accused West of trying to destabilise country, while Hungarian PM Orbán 27 Oct congratulated Georgian Dream, next day travelled to Tbilisi in show of support. Meanwhile, European Commission 30 Oct released report about Georgia’s progress on EU accession conditions, finding progress wanting and announcing suspension of its accession process until Georgian Dream “changes course”, referring to concerns about election as well as adoption of repressive legislation in 2024."
Türkiye,OCTOBER 2024,"Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) carried out attack in capital Ankara that killed five, prompting military to intensify airstrikes in northern Syria and northern Iraq; govt mulled new process to resolve conflict.","Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) carried out attack in capital Ankara that killed five, prompting military to intensify airstrikes in northern Syria and northern Iraq; govt mulled new process to resolve conflict. PKK killed five in Ankara, as govt considered new approach to Kurdish issue. Two attackers armed with assault rifles 23 Oct opened fire and detonated explosions at entrance of Turkish Aerospace Industries in Ankara, killing five and injuring at least 22; PKK 25 Oct claimed responsibility. In response, military targeted PKK and its Syrian affiliate in northern Iraq and northern Syria, respectively, hitting over 470 targets and “neutralising” 213 PKK members, according to President Erdoğan. PKK attack occurred just as govt appeared to test waters to see if new process to resolve four-decade conflict can be set in motion. Notably, Devlet Bahçeli, leader of the ultranationalist Nationalist Movement Party and President Erdoğan’s govt ally, in surprise statement 22 Oct said that authorities should give parole to imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan if he announces group’s dissolution; some media reports suggested that govt had facilitated contacts between imprisoned Öcalan and PKK leadership in Iraq, with Öcalan urging group to end its insurgency. Ankara 23 Oct permitted Öcalan’s nephew to visit him in prison, marking first such visit of family member in over three years. Erdoğan 30 Oct confirmed pursuit of new approach he described as “historic window of opportunity”, saying “My dear Kurdish brothers, we expect you to firmly grasp [Bahçeli’s] sincerely outstretched hand”.
